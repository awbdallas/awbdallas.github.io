# The Ideal Starter Kit of Books for New Programmers

Throughout the recent summer, I've had the wonderful opportunity to interact with several interns who are enthusiastic
about stepping into the world of programming. On many occasions, they've sought guidance on the top resources to
kickstart their journey. Therefore, I've compiled a list of recommended books that every beginner in the field should
read.

Please note: This list is primarily intended for those who are quite new to programming. This could include individuals
who have just completed their college education or are in the first year of their programming journey.

## The Kickoff Book: A Deep Dive into Practicality

* "The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas

#### Explanation

When you step into a large company as a new recruit, it's rather easy to immerse yourself into the daily grind and lose
sight of your main objectives. This book teaches you to stay pragmatic about your purpose within the organization and
the approach you should adopt to solve problems. Understanding this can greatly enhance your stamina for the long
journey ahead in your programming career.

## Following up: A Pursuit of Excellence in Code Writing

* "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin

#### Explanation

An important revelation that awaits you in Coding 101 is the fact that throughout your career, you'll end up reading
much more code than writing. So, it's quintessential that you can recognize and understand what clean code looks like
and how to write it yourself. A good grasp on these concepts not only optimizes your initial year in the field but also
lays a solid foundation for your future in the industry.

## Other Useful Tips for Beginners

### Get to Know your Code Editor

Regardless of which editor you choose to use, make a sincere effort to master it. It could be Emacs, VIM, or Intellij (a
great place to begin would be Key Promoter X).

### Leverage Maximum Code Suggestions

Editors such as Intellij and others have built-in features that highlight common mistakes. Make full use of these
toolkits by cranking up the suggestion intensity to the maximum for any changes you're overseeing.

### Prioritize the Problem, not the Tools

Many beginners fall into the trap of focusing on the tools before fully understanding the problem at hand. My advice
would be to initially concentrate on dissecting the problem, and then identifying the relevant tools that would assist
in solving it.

### Establish Open & Frequent Communication

Interacting with your superiors for the first time or dealing with the fear of the unknown can be daunting. Even so, I
recommend initiating dialogues about your tasks and your personal growth at the earliest. Doing so can open doors for
myriad opportunities in your journey.
